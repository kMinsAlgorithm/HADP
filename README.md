# HADP: Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner for Robust Navigation in Dynamic Obstacle Environments

> **Status:** Under review in *IEEE Access*

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for **HADP**, a hybrid planning system designed to generate stable and safe avoidance trajectories in dynamic obstacle environments.  

---

## ðŸš€ Environment

The experiments in this repository were conducted and validated in the [dynamic-obstacle-avoidance-simulator](https://github.com/kMinsAlgorithm/dynamic-obstacle-avoidance-simulator) environment.  
The simulator provides various scenarios for testing navigation systems under dynamic obstacle conditions.

## ðŸ“‚ Upcoming Releases

Additional modules will be released in the future, including:

- **Dynamic obstacle detection code**
- **Path generation server**

Stay tuned for updates!
