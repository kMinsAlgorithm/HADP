# HADP: Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner for Robust Navigation in Dynamic Obstacle Environments

> **Status:** Under review **

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for **HADP**, a hybrid planning system designed to generate stable and safe avoidance trajectories in dynamic obstacle environments.  

---

## 🚀 Environment

The experiments in this repository were conducted and validated in the [dynamic-obstacle-avoidance-simulator](https://github.com/kMinsAlgorithm/dynamic-obstacle-avoidance-simulator) environment.  
The simulator provides various scenarios for testing navigation systems under dynamic obstacle conditions.
